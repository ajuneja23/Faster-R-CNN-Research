# Faster-R-CNN-Research

This code was used to conduct research on the average testing time of Faster R-CNN models for self driving cars when hyperparameters like the number of fully connected layers are varied. Research conducted at Northwestern University. Thanks to Professor Wing Kam Liu, Xiayou Xie, and others who assisted in the process.
